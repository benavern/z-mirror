> a magic mirror done my way

## Requirements

* 1 Raspbery PI
* 1 screen (I bought mine 15â‚¬ second hand and as a bonus, it has a audio input)
* Pieces of wood
* 1 One-way mirror (I built it)
* Some time and a lot of courage

You'll probably want to be able to have the shopping list & the postits : there are some more things to do: 

* create your instance of the [z-mirror-api](https://github.com/benavern/z-mirror-api)
* host the [z-mirror-app](https://github.com/benavern/z-mirror-app) (don't forget to put some security on it)
## Raspbery pi settings

I used a fresh install of raspbian (July 2017 - kernel 4.9)

#### Rotate the screen
````
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
````
Add the following line:
````
display_rotate=1
avoid_warnings=1 
````

#### Disable the screensaver
````
sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
````
Add the following lines:
````
@xset s noblank
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
````

````
sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
````
Add the following line below `[SeatDefaults]`
````
xserver-command=X -s 0 -dpms
````

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install # or yarn

# create a config.json file in src
cp src/config.example.json src/config.json
# edit it the way you need

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev # or yarn run dev

# build electron application
npm run build:raspi # or yarn run build:raspi
# don't know why it does not work directly on the raspbery 
# so I built the app on my personnal computer
# then `scp` the build on my raspberry pi


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint # or yarn run lint

```
